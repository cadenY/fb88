                <p>I wish to be excluded from gambling with FABET88 and understand that once this form has been submitted my account (and any other accounts believed to be held by me) will be closed within a reasonable period of time; confirmation will be sent to your FABET88 registered email address.</p>
                <p>FABET88’s self-exclusion agreement involves a joint commitment from us and yourself, in agreeing to self-exclude you accept that you have a corresponding undertaking not to seek to circumvent the self-exclusion.</p>
                <p>Customers will be prevented from using their account for the requested exclusion period (6 months, one year, two years or five years) during which time we will take all reasonable steps to prevent the opening and use of new accounts. However, during the period of your exclusion, you have a parallel commitment not attempt to re-open your accounts or try to open new accounts.</p>
                <p>Accounts that have been self-excluded are unable to be reactivated under any circumstances until the expiry of the self-exclusion period.</p>
                <p>Self-Exclusion will not affect transactions (including deposits, transfers, bets and withdrawals) made prior to exclusion period. Once an account is closed for self-exclusion ‘cash out’ will not be available.</p>
                <p>All accounts will only be reopened at the discretion of FABET88, and only upon confirmation from the account holder that they understand the implications.</p>
